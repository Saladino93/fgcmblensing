# fgcmblensing
Foregrounds in CMB lensing iterative estimator.


See here for details about the roadmap https://github.com/Saladino93/knowledge/blob/master/Cosmology/Iterative%20CMB%20Lensing%20Foregrounds/Roadmap.md


## Steps to produce foreground biases plots

### Creating point source mask

For an example, look at the ``matched_filter.ipynb`` file.

### Running plancklens

Go to the omarbranch of plancklens, and run the ``lensingrec_quickstart.ipynb`` file.

### For some plotting

``fgplots.ipynb``
